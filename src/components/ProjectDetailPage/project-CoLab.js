          <h1>Prototyping with IDEO CoLab</h1>
        </div>
        <div className="main">
          <p className="summary">For two weeks in January and nine weeks in the summer of 2017, I took part in IDEO CoLab‚Äôs fellow in Cambridge and San Francisco respectively. Alongside partner companies, we explored applications of emerging technologies like IoT and AI in many fields from energy price markets to home security to transportation.</p>

          <h2>The Experience</h2>
          <p>Working in extremely rapid sprints spanning from 2 days to 7 weeks, I worked on interdisciplinary teams of 3 - 4. My teammates spanned from industrial and graphic designers, undergraduate students, MBAs, to even a rap producer. And my role in each project was just as multifaceted. I built brands and story telling animations as a graphic designer, prototyped in iOS and ReactJS as a software developer, and built cardboard prototypes as an industrial designer. Whatever the project demanded, our team ebbed and flowed as we navigated ambiguity.</p>

          <h2>The Work</h2>
          <p>The prototypes we created were focused on proving feasibility (testing AI in Tensor Flow and iOS apps for IoT)¬†, observing desirability (cardboard form factors used during user interviews), and even determining market viability (mathematic simulations to test new world market designs)</p>

            <h3>The Experience</h3>
            <p>Through a 7 week build sprint, we started from our simple "How Might We", motivated 
                  by Design Thinking to build prototypes to ask and answer questions, interviewing experts from the industries of utility and electric vehicle charging.
                  In the end, we developed a new business design using bi-directional chargers with public transit vehicles to store surplus solar energy and discharge 
                  energy back to the grid during times of high demand.</p>
            <p>We bounced around the world of electric vehicles, testing viability in different markets, 
              using mobile trackers and travel data to see if EVs truly would have extra battery space to utilize as an energy resevoir, interviewing EV owners to realize our target market, defining the necessary factors for this system to work.</p>

            <p className="subtitle">The lots of writing and notes that pushed us forward</p>

            <h3>The Final Prototype</h3>
            <p>In order to test the feasibility of a city-wide electric battery, we created a mathematic simulation. 
              <br/>We pulled routes from the San Francisco commute service <a href="https://www.chariot.com/" target="_blank">Chariot</a>, 
              technical specifications from <a href="https://chargedevs.com/features/new-eagle-teams-up-with-inventev-to-offer-electric-ford-transit-vans/" target="_blank">New Eagle's electrified Ford Transit Van</a>,
              and projected solar power surpluses and energy demands for 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final form was the simulation displayed on a big screen. A narrator screen was displayed on an iPad, showing animations for different scenes 
              that occur in the 24 hour life cycle of a Sparkfleet vehicle. The timelines are synced on both screens with Socket.io; the entire application was developed myself with ReactJS.

            <h3>Major Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
              Coming from Florida, I had little experience in the EV market or even a fluctuating energy market. 
              Our problem statement was characterized by its ambiguity, and although it brought some difficulties, 
              it allowed for an awesome amount of freedom for where we could go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putting trust in the Design Thinking process ended for the better. Our team went through weeks of ambiguous solutions, 
              fearful that we weren't going to end with a single concise solution. And in the end, we didn't. 
              Rather, we had managed to gather enough information to discover new untapped potential in the energy market. 
              Most importantly, our new business design was backedby months of research, interviews, and our simulation. 
              <br/>Our final prototype wasn't just a concise product that could be shipped the next day, but rather it conceptualized what the future could hold for electric vehicles: <br/>more than just a mode of transportation, but a solution to the scalability issues of energy industry of the future.

            <p className="summary">Tobi was a collection of 3 applications to assist in different portions of the hiring process: the resume screening, the interview, and determining the final pool of candidates.</p>

            <h3>Prototype 1 : Chatbot</h3>
            <p>Our chatboat (made available through Slack and Facebook Messenger) would take the user through a screening as an initial step of the application process. 
              The user would have a conversation with the chatbot or "TobiBot", first about the candidates information and then through a "game", 
              where TobiBot would explain a soccer game scenario, asking the candidate what would they do: "Pass or Dribble Forward". From this, we created a score for whether the person was more team-oriented or an individual player.
              The prototype showed that an advantage the chatbot platform can allow for basic screening questions during the hiring process without burdening the hiring team.
            </p>
            <h3>Prototype 2 : Interview Assistant</h3>
            <p>Based on data we gathered from Prototype 1 (TobiBot), we created an interview assistant using the Google Home. The resume and conversations from TobiBot would be parsed 
              to create a short summary about the candidate and suggested questions. This removed the disadvantage of having an unprepared interviewer. 
              The interviewer could walk in, ask Tobi for the debrief, and then provide the quick summary and suggested questions.

            <h3>Prototype 3 : Candidate Assistant</h3>
            <p>With the practice of "Technology-Lead Design", we wanted to push the boundaries of Tobi to test where the edges of AI's benefit in the hiring process was.
              So, we gave Tobi full power. What would happen if Tobi could choose the final candidates?
              <br/>We wanted real data, so we actually pulled from the IDEO CoLab Makeathon data (so our actual applications to IDEO CoLab) to see if Tobi would get it right.; whether it would choose the same candidates that IDEO chose.
              <br/>Though we cannot disclose the results, we did gain insights on the limitations of AI in hiring, and from this, we defined new guidelines for designing this form of an AI system.

              SparkCore. Placed directly in front of the AC unit, the bend determined how much power was being exerted from the AC.
              <br/>On top of that, we created a HUB that included a thermometer and air pressure sensor to determine if any doors or windows were being opened.
              <br/>Based on this data, we compared in inside temperature with outside temperature and other sensors to determine if the 
              home owner could do actions to better the retention of heat in their room, whether that was keeping doors and windows closed, reducing AC, etc.

              The main takeaway of the project was how using a multi-sensor network can allow for dispensible parts, adding and removing sensors from
              the system based on the comfort of the user. Adding sensors only made the network more robust, while removing would not render the system useless.

              coming from lots of different parts of the globe. Over those 8 hours, I was introduced to Design Thinking, IDEO overall, the CoLab, and
              the intensity of design sprints. It was the start of my journey with IDEO CoLab. I flew back home to Florida excited for what there might have been to come.
