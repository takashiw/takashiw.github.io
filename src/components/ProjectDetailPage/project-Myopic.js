          <h2>I. The Mission</h2>
          <p>This project was created for Assignment 1 of the VR For Social Good class I am taking Senior Fall Semester at UF. The assignment is to "educate the user on a message to address a social good topic".</p>
          <p>The social good topic (cause vision democratization is always awesome to develop for) I chose was providing kids in elementary school with glasses. The non-profit I based this project on is Vision to Learn, a LA-based non-profit who provide "free eye exams and free eyeglasses to students in low income neighborhoods".</p>

          <h2>II. The Simulation</h2>
          <p>The VR experience takes you through the following</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A presentation of the problem space (scarcity of eyeglasses for kids)</li>
            <li>Simulation of first grade spelling lesson where you look at the board and spell along </li>
            <li>Same Simulation, but this time with 20/200 vision </li>
            <li>Your attention results and other facts</li>
          </ol>

          <p className="subtitle">1.5 million first graders need glasses, but only 5% get them</p>

          <p className="subtitle">Classroom setting with red raycast to track users attention span</p>

          <p className="subtitle">Results lobby with rotating trophies with detailed benefits</p>

          <h2>III. Models</h2>
          <p>All of the models were created by myself in Blender!</p>
          <p>No outside models were used</p>
